<dt>a. WhenHTML5 has become a standard?What were the main reasonsfordeveloping 
new standard</dt>
<dd>A:HTML5 became a standard on October 28, 2014.
The main reasons for developing a new standard like HTML5 were:
Richer multimedia support，The need for better support for multimedia elements such as audio and video without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.
Improved semantics:，To provide better structure and semantics to web content, making it easier for search engines to index and understand the content
Enhanced accessibility: To improve accessibility features for users with disabilities, making it easier for developers to create more inclusive websites.
Cross-platform compatibility，To ensure that web applications work consistently across different devices and platforms, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Better performance，To optimize the performance of web applications, making them faster and more responsive.</dd>
<dt>b. What is a difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard?</dt>
<dd>B:The main difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard lies in their development processes and update mechanisms:
W3C HTML5:
   - W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is an international community that develops standards for the web.
   - W3C HTML5 refers to the specific version of HTML that was finalized and published as a formal recommendation by the W3C in October 2014.
   - W3C HTML5 is a stable version with a fixed set of features and specifications.
   - Updates to W3C HTML5 are made through the W3C's standardization process, which involves various working groups and committees.
WHATWG HTML Living Standard:
   - WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) is a community of web developers and browser vendors who collaborate on evolving web technologies.
   - WHATWG HTML Living Standard is a continuously updated version of HTML that reflects the latest developments and best practices in web technology.
   - The HTML Living Standard is constantly evolving and does not have a fixed version number like HTML5.
   - Updates to the HTML Living Standard are made in real-time based on community feedback and consensus within the WHATWG community.</dd>
<dt>c. What is the minimal HTML page code?</dt>
<dd>C:(Here I use () instead, otherwise it will cause the code to display errors)
The minimal HTML page code includes the essential elements needed to create a valid HTML document.for example
html
(!DOCTYPE html)
This declaration specifies the HTML version being used
(html)
 The root element of an HTML document. All other elements are contained within the (html) tags.
(head)
 Contains metadata about the document, such as the document title, links to stylesheets, and other resources.
    (title)Title of the Page(title)
 Defines the title of the HTML document, which is displayed in the browser tab or window title bar.
(head)
(body)
Contains the main content of the HTML document that will be displayed in the browser window.
    Content of the Page
(body)
(html) </dd>
<dt>d. Comment on semanticand presentationalmarkup. Why presentationalmarkup is 
considered deprecated now?</dt>
<dd>D:Semantic Markup:
   - Semantic markup focuses on using HTML elements to convey the meaning and structure of the content.
   - It involves choosing the appropriate HTML elements based on the meaning of the content, rather than how it should look.
   - Semantic markup helps search engines and assistive technologies understand the content better, improving accessibility and SEO.
   - Examples of semantic elements include (header), (nav), (section）, （article）, （footer）.
Presentational Markup:
   - Presentational markup involves using HTML elements to define the visual appearance of the content.
   - It includes using elements like （font）, （b), (i), (center), etc., which directly affect the styling of the content.
   - Presentational markup mixes content with styling, making it harder to maintain and update the design of a website.
   - This approach is considered outdated and not recommended for modern web development practices. 
By separating content and presentation, websites become more accessible, maintainable, and adaptable to different devices and screen sizes</dd>
<dt>e. How you can check browsersupport for particular tag or attribute?</dt>
<dd>E:To check browser support for a particular HTML tag or attribute, can use online resources such as caniuse.com or MDN Web Docs. </dd>
<dt>f. What are the audio and video formats, officially supported byHTML standard? What 
happens if you use other format?</dt>
<dd>F:The HTML standard officially supports several audio and video formats for embedding multimedia content in web pages. The most commonly supported audio and video formats are:
1. Audio Formats:MP3,WAV. Ogg Vorbis.
2.Video Formats:MP4,WebM4,Ogg Theora
These formats are supported by most modern web browsers for embedding audio and video content using the (audio) and (video) elements in HTML. When using multimedia content on a website,
 it's essential to provide fallback options in different formats to ensure compatibility across various browsers and devices.If use an audio or video format that is not officially supported by the HTML standard 
or widely supported by web browsers, several potential issues may arise:
Browsers may not be able to play the audio or video content if they do not support the format. 
Without a fallback option in a supported format, users accessing the webpage on browsers that do not support the chosen format will not be able to view or listen to the multimedia content.
Unsupported formats may not be optimized for web playback, leading to slower loading times or performance issues when streaming or playing the audio or video content.
Users may experience frustration or confusion if they encounter multimedia content that they cannot access or view properly due to format compatibility issues.</dd>

  <p>Hello teacher, I like this assignment very much. Although I wrote it all afternoon, the process of exploring and gaining new knowledge is very interesting. I understand the process and logic of everything. The most difficult time is at the beginning. I didn't know where to start, so I searched for a lot of information online. When I had enough information, I put it together and the homework started to become clear. I learned how to create a simple web page and design its size and color. If there are any mistakes in my work, please tell me, thank you very much!</p>
