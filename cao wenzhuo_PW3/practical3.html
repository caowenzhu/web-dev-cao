                <p class="one">JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group),good for photographs and complex images with many colors.Supports compression levels, allowing for a balance between image quality and file size.</p>
                <p class="two"> PNG (Portable Network Graphics),it supports transparency and lossless compression. great for images with text, logos, and graphics with sharp edges.</p>
